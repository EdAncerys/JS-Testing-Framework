## Testing framework

A testing framework for Javascript in the browser, loosely based on jasmine syntax. This was developed as part of an exercise while coding at Makers.

## TODO

Add example tests using mock  
Add example tests using .toEqual  
Add example tests using .notToEqual  
Add example tests using .toBeAnArray  
Implement async testing

## Further Development

Ideas to improve test framework

- Add feature to log/print error messages in UI
- Add extra hooks for added functionality and expand on testing capabilities
- Improve UI for more user friendly usage
